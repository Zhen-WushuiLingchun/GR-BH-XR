# Development Log

Use this log to keep academic and physics-facing context close to the code.
For large entries, create a separate `docs/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` note and link it
from here.

## Log

### 2026-06-28 - Repository documentation protocol

- Goal: Establish project documentation rules for agent work, literature
  tracking, development logs, and local-only paper drafts.
- Changed files / components: `AGENTS.md`, `references/references.md`,
  `docs/development_log.md`, `.gitignore`, and local `paper_draft/`.
- Academic reason: Keep implementation decisions traceable to literature,
  assumptions, and project-level scientific reasoning from the beginning.
- Physical correspondence: No physics model has been implemented yet; this
  entry only defines the protocol for documenting future model-to-visualization
  mappings.
- Assumptions and conventions: Literature entries belong in
  `references/references.md`; manuscript drafts remain local in `paper_draft/`.
- Validation: Confirm repository layout and Git ignore behavior after editing.
- References: None.
- Open issues / next steps: Add technology-stack-specific build, test, and
  validation instructions once the project architecture is chosen.
