## Log

### 2026-06-28 - Phase 0 literature and code baseline

- Goal: Complete the Phase 0 literature/code baseline before starting the CPU
  Kerr solver.
- Changed files / components: `references/pdfs/*.pdf`,
  `references/references.bib`, `references/references.md`,
  `references/code_reviews/2026-06-28-reference-code-baseline.md`,
  `references/source_notes/2026-06-28-phase0-download-log.md`,
  `docs/validation_targets.md`, and `validation/README.md`.
- Academic reason: Make the project auditable from source paper to validation
  target before numerical implementation begins.
- Physical correspondence: RAPTOR, AART, Odyssey, ipole, and grtrans were
  reviewed as external baselines for ray tracing, GRRT, adaptive photon-ring
  sampling, and later polarized-transfer diagnostics. No equations were changed
  in this step.
- Assumptions and conventions: Open arXiv PDFs are stored in `references/pdfs/`;
  third-party code is not vendored; GPL/BSD/MIT license notes are recorded only
  to guide future comparison boundaries.
- Validation: Phase 0 is validated by repository navigation checks,
  `git diff --check`, local-only PDF ignore checks, PDF binary attribute checks,
  and confirming all indexed PDF paths exist.
- References: See `references/references.md`, `references/references.bib`, and
  `references/code_reviews/2026-06-28-reference-code-baseline.md`.
- Open issues / next steps: Start Phase 1 with a CPU Schwarzschild/Kerr
  reference solver and selected-ray diagnostic output.

### 2026-06-28 - PDF literature storage convention

- Goal: Add a dedicated place for original literature PDFs while keeping the
  central reference index authoritative.
- Changed files / components: `references/pdfs/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `references/references.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`,
  `docs/plans/2026-06-28-physics-auditable-renderer.md`, and
  `references/source_notes/2026-06-28-physics-auditable-renderer-sources.md`.
- Academic reason: Make it easy to inspect original papers next to their
  summaries and project-use notes.
- Physical correspondence: No physics equations changed; this is a source
  traceability improvement for future derivations and benchmark claims.
- Assumptions and conventions: Open or safely redistributable PDFs may be stored
  in `references/pdfs/`; restricted, license-unclear, temporary, or oversized
  PDFs belong in ignored `references/pdfs/local_only/`.
- Validation: Confirm `references/pdfs/local_only/` is ignored while
  `references/pdfs/README.md` remains tracked.
- References: Existing entries in `references/references.md` now include a
  `PDF path` field.
- Open issues / next steps: Download and index open-access PDFs for the initial
  RAPTOR, AART, BHAC, and Davelaar papers when needed.

### 2026-06-28 - Physics-auditable renderer roadmap

- Goal: Convert the project direction into a staged physics-auditable renderer
  plan.
- Changed files / components: `docs/plans/2026-06-28-physics-auditable-renderer.md`,
  `docs/physical_scope.md`, `docs/equations.md`, `docs/validation_targets.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `references/references.md`, and
  `references/source_notes/2026-06-28-physics-auditable-renderer-sources.md`.
- Academic reason: Prevent the project from becoming a visual-only black-hole
  shader by requiring transfer quantities, validation targets, and literature
  traceability.
- Physical correspondence: The core renderer is framed as a map from observer
  screen coordinates `(alpha, beta)` to capture state, disk crossing data,
  redshift, time delay, image order, optical depth, and observed intensity.
- Assumptions and conventions: First-year work targets single-Kerr physics and
  Quest PCVR/MR display. Full GRMHD, BBH numerical relativity, Quest-native
  GRRT, and direct neural image generation are deferred.
- Validation: Documentation-level validation only; no solver exists yet. The
  plan defines future checks for Hamiltonian drift, conserved quantities,
  Schwarzschild shadow radius, disk transfer, headset behavior, and benchmark
  comparisons.
- References: See `references/references.md` entries for RAPTOR, Odyssey, BHAC,
  AART, Davelaar VR work, Meta Quest documentation, Unity OpenXR Meta
  passthrough documentation, and Meta Depth API.
- Open issues / next steps: Choose the initial reference-solver language and
  data format, then implement Phase 1 CPU Kerr geodesic validation.

### 2026-06-28 - Repository documentation protocol

- Goal: Establish project documentation rules for agent work, literature
  tracking, development logs, and local-only paper drafts.
- Changed files / components: `AGENTS.md`, `references/references.md`,
  `docs/development_log.md`, `.gitignore`, and local `paper_draft/`.
- Academic reason: Keep implementation decisions traceable to literature,
  assumptions, and project-level scientific reasoning from the beginning.
- Physical correspondence: No physics model has been implemented yet; this
  entry only defines the protocol for documenting future model-to-visualization
  mappings.
- Assumptions and conventions: Literature entries belong in
  `references/references.md`; manuscript drafts remain local in `paper_draft/`.
- Validation: Confirm repository layout and Git ignore behavior after editing.
- References: None.
- Open issues / next steps: Add technology-stack-specific build, test, and
  validation instructions once the project architecture is chosen.
